                <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>We are team of software engineers who also invest in stocks, Back in the days when we started making investments 
            we used other sites such as robinhood, we were not even sure where to begin, but this gave us the motivation to help others 
            who are in the same position as we were. Because of this we decided to create our own stock investment site.
