        <p>We are team of software engineers who also invest in stocks 
        <br>back when we started making investments in other sites such 
        <br>as robinhood, we were not sure where to begin but this gave
        <br>us the motivation to help others who are in the same position
        <br>as us by creating our own stock investment site.
