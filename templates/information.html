                      Stocks are basically the shares of ownership in a company and stockholders 
                      have a fractional ownership of the company. Stocks are typically listed as line graphs
                      and they basically keep track of the stock price of the company overtime. 
                      It can show the companies records by daily, monthly, and yearly.

                    The best way to start is to do paper trading which will allow users
                    to buy and sell on a simulator without having to invest real money
                    that way the user is practicing before they decide to invest. 
                    Paper trading is possible through opening a brokerage account
                    which is the quickest method of buying stocks.

                    Our website gives users the option to buy or sell a stock. The users
                    will also have a portfolio page to show their records on how many orders they
                    have made, and how many wins and losses they have on the stock simulator.

                    We also have a leaderboards page to show all the users current records on 
                    the stock sim, so users will know who is leading with investments and who is behind.
                    The purpose of the leaderboard is to make our simluator more competitive.
