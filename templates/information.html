                <h2>The Basics of Stock Markets</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Stocks are basically the shares of ownership in a company and stockholders 
                    <br>have a fractional ownership of the company. Stocks are typically listed as line graphs
                    <br> and they basically keep track of the stock price of the company overtime. 
                    <br>It can show the companies records by daily, monthly, and yearly.
                    <br>
                    Below is an example of a graph showing Googles shares for the past 6 years.
                    <br>

                    <h2>How Should I Start Investing?</h2>
                     <p>The best way to start is to do paper trading which will allow users
                    <br>to buy and sell on a simulator without having to invest real money
                     <br>that way the user is practicing before they decide to invest real
                     <br>money. Paper trading is possible through opening a brokerage account
                    <br>which is the quickest method of buying stocks.    
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Our website gives users the option to buy or sell a stock. The users
                    <br>will also have a portfolio page to show their records on how many orders they
                    <br>have made, and how many wins and losses they have on the stock simulator.
                    <br>We also have a leaderboards page to show all the users current records on 
                    <br>the stock sim, so everyone will know who is leading.
