                    The best way to start is to do paper trading which will allow users
                    to buy and sell on a simulator without having to invest real money
                    that way the user is practicing before they decide to invest. 
                    Paper trading is possible through opening a brokerage account
                    which is the quickest method of buying stocks.

                  <h5 class="card-text" style = "text-align: left;">Our website gives users the ability to start a stock simulation, which simulates a real stock investment

                    starting cash.

                    During the simulation, the users will have the option to buy a stock from the company
                    they have searched and will be asked the quantity of how much they would like to purchase.

                    <br><br>
                    We also have a leaderboards page to show all the users current records on 
                    the stock sim, so users will know who is leading with the most investments and who is behind.
